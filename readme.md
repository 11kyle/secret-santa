I originally wanted to use more class properties (For example: previousSelections:[String] and family[String]) but I felt like the conditionals would get a bit messy.
Improvements
-utilized Error Handling more
-allow the user to input names
-setup a Realm database

Part 3
I didn't complete part 3 but I would have just assigned names to unavailableNames in the listOfPeople declaration as family members. In that way, Part 3 is identical to Part 2. If I had used more class properties, Part 3 would have had an additional familyMembers property which would have required an additional conditional.

I wanted to use swift because I thought it would be a language used more frequently in this position. I feel that I could have done better with javascript since I have written that more as of lately.

Unit-tests
I used different list lengths to test my application
Edge cases were needed once the last two names were left to be assigned a match in order to make sure the last person wasn't left with his/her own name.
